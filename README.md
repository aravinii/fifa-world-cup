Tentative to predict the champion of the 2022 fifa world cup

I got (a bit late) into the world cup mood and also developed my algorithm to predict the champion of that edition...ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·

I used part of what I learned during my MBA in Data Science at the University of SÃ£o Paulo, together with the great advisor Francisco Rodrigues, to do a kind of "combination" of Recommender Systems + Probability techniques. 

Basically, it was a mixture of Adamic Adar Link Prediction, considering a network composed of goals made by national teams in common opponents + a frequentist probability considering the historical goals in direct confrontations!

I'll be very happy if you can leave your impressions/feedbacks on this little mess and, if you've joined the bandwagon too, please leave your approximations in the comments! <3
